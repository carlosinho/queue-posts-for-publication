A plugin to queue and schedule posts for future publication on the next available slot.

== Description ==

Queue Posts for Publication is a WordPress plugin that allows you to manage and schedule your posts for future publication.

It lets you first set the available publication slots in a simplified way - like, "Mon at 1PM" and then lets you queue posts to be published at the next available time - or at the time you select from the list of future slots.

It also shows a calendar view (and list view) of posts scheduled into the future.

= Features =

* Queue posts for next available slot
* Pick a specific slot for publication
* Add/remove publication slots
* Calendar view of scheduled posts
* Support for both classic and block editor
* Easy-to-use admin interface - integrated into your post editing screen

== Installation ==

1. Upload archive or install from the official directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Go to Queue Posts from the wp-admin sidebar to configure your publication slots
4. Queue any post draft for publication

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a new publication slot? =

Go to Queue Posts. Select the day of the week and time for the new slot. Click the "Add Slot" button. 

= Can I edit a queued post? =

Yes, you can edit a queued post at any time before it's published. The post will maintain its position in the queue.

The plugin doesn't interfere at all with WordPress' native post publication or scheduling mechanisms, nor with any of the WordPress features you know and love.

= What happens if I delete a publication slot? =

If you delete a publication slot, that slot will no longer be used for any future publications. All posts already scheduled at that slot will remain their schedule.
