3. Go to "Queue Posts" from the wp-admin sidebar to configure your publication slots.
4. Queue any post draft for publication.

### Usage

1. Define your publication slots (e.g., multiple days/times each week).

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I add a new publication slot?

Go to "Queue Posts". Select the day of the week and time for the new slot, then click the "Add Slot" button.

#### Can I edit a queued post?

Yes. You can edit a queued post at any time before it's published. The post will maintain its position in the queue. The plugin doesn't interfere with WordPress' native post publication or scheduling mechanisms.

#### What happens if I delete a publication slot?

If you delete a publication slot, that slot will no longer be used for future publications. All posts already scheduled at that slot will retain their existing schedule.
